== School timetabling

In school timetabling, we need to assign a list of lessons to timeslots and rooms.
Additionally, there are some constraints:

- A room can have at most one lesson at the same time.

- A teacher can teach at most one lesson at the same time.

- A student can attend at most one lesson at the same time.

- A teacher prefers to teach all lessons in the same room.

- A teacher prefers to teach sequential lessons and dislikes gaps between lessons.

- A student dislikes sequential lessons on the same subject.

== Modelling the domain

The Objects used in constraints are known as the domain of the problem. In school timetabling, the domain consist of lessons, rooms and timeslots.

=== Problem Facts

Problem facts do not change throughout solving. Rooms and timeslots are examples of problem facts. Create a `domain.py` file with the following code to create the `Room` class:

[source,python]
----
from optapy import problem_fact, planning_id

@problem_fact
class Room:
    def __init__(self, id, name):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name

    @planning_id
    def get_id(self):
        return self.id

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Room(id={self.id}, name={self.name})"
----

The `@problem_fact` decorator registers the class as a problem fact, which allows it to be used in constraints.
The `@planning_id` decorator registers `getId` as the planning ID for `Room`. OptaPy requires a planning ID for some functionality, such as generating unique pairs. The planning ID should be unique for instances of the same class.

Now, in `domain.py`, let's add the following code to create the `Timeslot` class:

[source,python]
----
@problem_fact
class Timeslot:
    def __init__(self, id, day_of_week, start_time, end_time):
        self.id = id
        self.day_of_week = day_of_week
        self.start_time = start_time
        self.end_time = end_time

    @planning_id
    def get_id(self):
        return self.id

    def __str__(self):
        return (
                f"Timeslot("
                f"id={self.id}, "
                f"day_of_week={self.day_of_week}, "
                f"start_time={self.start_time}, "
                f"end_time={self.end_time})"
        )
----

=== Planning Entities

Planning entities change throughout solving. Lesson is a planning entity, since its `room` and
`timeslot` properties change throughout solving. Since the `room` and `timeslot` properties change throughout solving, they are known as planning variables. Let's add the following code to `domain.py` to create the `Lesson` class.

[source,python]
----
from optapy import planning_entity, planning_variable

@planning_entity
class Lesson:
    def __init__(self, id, subject, teacher, student_group, timeslot=None, room=None):
        self.id = id
        self.subject = subject
        self.teacher = teacher
        self.student_group = student_group
        self.timeslot = timeslot
        self.room = room

    @planning_id
    def get_id(self):
        return self.id

    @planning_variable(Timeslot, ["timeslotRange"])
    def get_timeslot(self):
        return self.timeslot

    def set_timeslot(self, new_timeslot):
        self.timeslot = new_timeslot

    @planning_variable(Room, ["roomRange"])
    def get_room(self):
        return self.room

    def set_room(self, new_room):
        self.room = new_room

    def __str__(self):
        return (
            f"Lesson("
            f"id={self.id}, "
            f"timeslot={self.timeslot}, "
            f"room={self.room}, "
            f"teacher={self.teacher}, "
            f"subject={self.subject}, "
            f"student_group={self.student_group}"
            f")"
        )
----

The `@planning_entity` decorator registers the class as a planning entity, which allows OptaPy to assign its planning variables and for it to be used in constraints.
The `@planning_variable(variable_type, [value_range_provider_refs...])` decorator registers a method as the getter of a planning variable.
The getter must be named `get<X>` and the setter must be named `set<X>`.
The first argument, `variable_type`, tells OptaPy what type of values OptaPy can assign to this planning variable.
The second argument, `value_range_provider_refs`, tells OptaPy what value ranges it takes its values from. We will explain value ranges later in this example.

== Constraints

Constraints define the score calculation, or the fitness function, of a planning problem. Each solution of a planning problem is graded with a score. A score represents the quality of a specific solution. The higher the score the better. OptaPy looks for the best solution, which is the solution with the highest score found in the available time. It might or might not be the optimal solution.

Because this use case has hard and soft constraints, use the HardSoftScore class to represent the score:

- Hard constraints must not be broken. For example: _A room can have at most one lesson at the same time_.

- Soft constraints should not be broken. For example: _A teacher prefers to teach in a single room_.

Hard constraints are weighted against other hard constraints. Soft constraints are weighted too, against other soft constraints. Hard constraints always outweigh soft constraints, regardless of their respective weights.

To calculate the score, create a constraint provider function in the file `constraints.py`:

[source,python]
----
from domain import Lesson, Room
from optapy import constraint_provider
from optapy.constraint import Joiners, ConstraintFactory
from optapy.score import HardSoftScore

@constraint_provider
def define_constraints(constraint_factory: ConstraintFactory):
    return [
        # Hard constraints
        room_conflict(constraint_factory),
        teacher_conflict(constraint_factory),
        student_group_conflict(constraint_factory),
        # Soft constraints are only implemented in the optapy-quickstarts code
    ]

def room_conflict(constraint_factory: ConstraintFactory):
    # A room can accommodate at most one lesson at the same time.
    return constraint_factory.for_each(Lesson) \
            .join(Lesson,
                  # ... in the same timeslot ...
                  Joiners.equal(lambda lesson: lesson.timeslot),
                  # ... in the same room ...
                  Joiners.equal(lambda lesson: lesson.room),
                  # ... and the pair is unique (different id, no reverse pairs) ...
                  Joiners.less_than(lambda lesson: lesson.id)
             ) \
            .penalize("Room conflict", HardSoftScore.ONE_HARD)


def teacher_conflict(constraint_factory: ConstraintFactory):
    # A teacher can teach at most one lesson at the same time.
    return constraint_factory.for_each(Lesson) \
                .join(Lesson,
                      Joiners.equal(lambda lesson: lesson.timeslot),
                      Joiners.equal(lambda lesson: lesson.teacher),
                      Joiners.less_than(lambda lesson: lesson.id)
                ) \
                .penalize("Teacher conflict", HardSoftScore.ONE_HARD)

def student_group_conflict(constraint_factory: ConstraintFactory):
    # A student can attend at most one lesson at the same time.
    return constraint_factory.for_each(Lesson) \
            .join(Lesson,
                  Joiners.equal(lambda lesson: lesson.timeslot),
                  Joiners.equal(lambda lesson: lesson.student_group),
                  Joiners.less_than(lambda lesson: lesson.id)
            ) \
            .penalize("Student group conflict", HardSoftScore.ONE_HARD)
----

The `@constraint_provider` decorator allows OptaPy to use a function as a constraint provider.
The function must take exactly one argument; the passed argument is a `ConstraintFactory` used for creating constraints.
For more information, see https://docs.optaplanner.org/latest/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#constraintStreams[Constraint Streams] in the OptaPy documentation.

== Gather the domain objects in a planning solution

A TimeTable class wraps all Timeslot, Room, and Lesson instances of a single data set.
Furthermore, because it contains all lessons, each with a specific planning variable state, the TimeTable class is a planning solution and has a score:

- If lessons are still unassigned, then it is an _uninitialized_ solution, for example, a solution with the score -4init/0hard/0soft.

- If it breaks hard constraints, then it is an _infeasible_ solution, for example, a solution with the score -2hard/-3soft.

- If it adheres to all hard constraints, then it is a _feasible_ solution, for example, a solution with the score 0hard/-7soft.

In `domain.py`, add the following code to create the `TimeTable` class:

[source,python]
----
from optapy import planning_solution, planning_entity_collection_property, \
                   problem_fact_collection_property, \
                   value_range_provider, planning_score
from optapy.score import HardSoftScore

def format_list(a_list):
    return ',\n'.join(map(str, a_list))

@planning_solution
class TimeTable:
    def __init__(self, timeslot_list, room_list, lesson_list, score=None):
        self.timeslot_list = timeslot_list
        self.room_list = room_list
        self.lesson_list = lesson_list
        self.score = score

    @problem_fact_collection_property(Timeslot)
    @value_range_provider("timeslotRange")
    def get_timeslot_list(self):
        return self.timeslot_list

    @problem_fact_collection_property(Room)
    @value_range_provider("roomRange")
    def get_room_list(self):
        return self.room_list

    @planning_entity_collection_property(Lesson)
    def get_lesson_list(self):
        return self.lesson_list

    @planning_score(HardSoftScore)
    def get_score(self):
        return self.score

    def set_score(self, score):
        self.score = score

    def __str__(self):
        return (
            f"TimeTable("
            f"timeslot_list={format_list(self.timeslot_list)},\n"
            f"room_list={format_list(self.room_list)},\n"
            f"lesson_list={format_list(self.lesson_list)},\n"
            f"score={str(self.score.toString()) if self.score is not None else 'None'}"
            f")"
        )
----

The `@planning_solution` decorator tells OptaPy that the class `TimeTable` holds the input and output data.
The `@problem_fact_collection_property(fact_type)` decorator tells OptaPy the function that provides problem facts.
The `fact_type` argument tells OptaPy what type of fact it provides (for instance, Rooms).

The `@value_range_provider(range_id)` decorator tells OptaPy the function that provides a value range, which is used to get possible values of planning variables.
Its argument, `range_id` is a string which is used in `@planning_variable` decorators to link the two (for example, `@planning_variable(Room, ['roomRange'])` is linked to `@value_range_provider('roomRange')`.

The `@planning_entity_collection_property(entity_type)` decorator tells OptaPy the function that provides planning entities.
The `entity_type` argument tells OptaPy what type of entities it provides (for instance, Lessons).

The `@planning_score(score_type)` decorator tells OptaPy the function that returns the score.
It must be named `get<X>` and have a corresponding a setter `set<X>`.
The `score_type` argument tells OptaPy what type of score to use (for instance, `HardSoftScore`).
The type should be taken from the `optapy.score` module.

== Solving

To solve, we first need to create an instance of our problem. Add the following code to `domain.py`:
[source,python]
----
from datetime import time

def generate_problem():
    timeslot_list = [
        Timeslot(1, "MONDAY", time(hour=8, minute=30), time(hour=9, minute=30)),
        Timeslot(2, "MONDAY", time(hour=9, minute=30), time(hour=10, minute=30)),
        Timeslot(3, "MONDAY", time(hour=10, minute=30), time(hour=11, minute=30)),
        Timeslot(4, "MONDAY", time(hour=13, minute=30), time(hour=14, minute=30)),
        Timeslot(5, "MONDAY", time(hour=14, minute=30), time(hour=15, minute=30)),
        Timeslot(6, "TUESDAY", time(hour=8, minute=30), time(hour=9, minute=30)),
        Timeslot(7, "TUESDAY", time(hour=9, minute=30), time(hour=10, minute=30)),
        Timeslot(8, "TUESDAY", time(hour=10, minute=30), time(hour=11, minute=30)),
        Timeslot(9, "TUESDAY", time(hour=13, minute=30), time(hour=14, minute=30)),
        Timeslot(10, "TUESDAY", time(hour=14, minute=30), time(hour=15, minute=30)),
    ]
    room_list = [
        Room(1, "Room A"),
        Room(2, "Room B"),
        Room(3, "Room C")
    ]
    lesson_list = [
        Lesson(1, "Math", "A. Turing", "9th grade"),
        Lesson(2, "Math", "A. Turing", "9th grade"),
        Lesson(3, "Physics", "M. Curie", "9th grade"),
        Lesson(4, "Chemistry", "M. Curie", "9th grade"),
        Lesson(5, "Biology", "C. Darwin", "9th grade"),
        Lesson(6, "History", "I. Jones", "9th grade"),
        Lesson(7, "English", "I. Jones", "9th grade"),
        Lesson(8, "English", "I. Jones", "9th grade"),
        Lesson(9, "Spanish", "P. Cruz", "9th grade"),
        Lesson(10, "Spanish", "P. Cruz", "9th grade"),
        Lesson(11, "Math", "A. Turing", "10th grade"),
        Lesson(12, "Math", "A. Turing", "10th grade"),
        Lesson(13, "Math", "A. Turing", "10th grade"),
        Lesson(14, "Physics", "M. Curie", "10th grade"),
        Lesson(15, "Chemistry", "M. Curie", "10th grade"),
        Lesson(16, "French", "M. Curie", "10th grade"),
        Lesson(17, "Geography", "C. Darwin", "10th grade"),
        Lesson(18, "History", "I. Jones", "10th grade"),
        Lesson(19, "English", "P. Cruz", "10th grade"),
        Lesson(20, "Spanish", "P. Cruz", "10th grade"),
    ]
    lesson = lesson_list[0]
    lesson.set_timeslot(timeslot_list[0])
    lesson.set_room(room_list[0])

    return TimeTable(timeslot_list, room_list, lesson_list)
----

Next, we need to create a `SolverConfig`, which tells OptaPy about the problem and what strategies to employ. In `main.py`, add the following code:

[source,python]
----
from domain import Lesson, TimeTable, generate_problem
from constraints import define_constraints
import optapy.config
from optapy.types import Duration

solver_config = optapy.config.solver.SolverConfig() \
    .withEntityClasses(Lesson) \
    .withSolutionClass(TimeTable) \
    .withConstraintProviderClass(define_constraints) \
    .withTerminationSpentLimit(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
----

For the `SolverConfig` above, we use the default strategies, use the model we defined above, and set it terminate after 30 seconds.

Finally, we pass the `SolverConfig` and the problem instance to the `solve` function, which returns the last best solution found. Add the following code to `main.py`:

[source,python]
----
from optapy import solver_factory_create

solution = solver_factory_create(solver_config) \
    .buildSolver() \
    .solve(generate_problem())

print(solution)
----

The solution returned is a `TimeTable` instance
of the best solution found.
When the solution is formatted into a table, it should look similar to this:
